# Backend, Cloud & AI Software Development, Architecture & Server Administration

*Helping people build AI, backend systems, and decentralized infrastructure with clarity and care.*

## Summary

Backend-focused developer and architect with deep experience in cloud infrastructure, AI deployment, and privacy-first tooling. Whether building scalable APIs, fine-tuning LLMs, or running Ethereum validator nodes, I approach tech with a balance of precision, pragmatism, and curiosity.

## Artificial Intelligence

* Design and deployment of **custom LLM environments** (software-side, not hardware assembly)
* Local and cloud-based GPT installation, training (**RAG**, **LoRA fine-tuning**), and deployment
* **Prompt engineering** and creation of **custom GPT instruction sets**
* Experience with both local models (e.g. **Mistral**, **LLaMa**) and cloud-based solutions (**ChatGPT**, **Anthropic**, **Gemini**)
* **AI automation** via agents built in **n8n**
* **Web-based chat** integrations using **openwebui**
* Experimental **“vibe” coding** using **Roo**, **Cline**, **Cursor** and **Warp Terminal**

## Software Development & Architecture

* End-to-end architecture, development, and deployment of **APIs**, **webhooks**, and **integrations**
* Experience with **microservices**, **gRPC**, **message queues**, and **onion architecture**
* Development in **JavaScript**, **.NET**, and **Python**
* Cloud-native and on-premise systems using **Azure**, **AWS**, **DigitalOcean** (great for small businesses), and **Ubuntu Server**
* Frameworks include **Flask**, **NestJS**, and **ASP.NET WebAPI**
* Experience with **Azure Functions** and **AWS Lambdas**
* Proficient in **CI/CD pipelines**, **automated testing**, and **linting**

## Server Administration

* Deployment and management of **custom and open-source** server software
* Hosting in both **cloud environments** and **local networks** (DNS-enabled)
* Projects include:

>  * Websites (e.g. **WordPress**)
>  * Mailing systems (e.g. **Listmonk**, **Postfix**, **OpenDKIM**)
>  * Messaging platforms (e.g. **Matrix/Element**)
>  * Blogging and newsletter tools (e.g. **Ghost**)
>  * Monitoring dashboards (e.g. **Grafana**, **Prometheus**)

## Privacy & Deplatforming

* Advising and implementing **privacy-first** tech stacks
* Deep experience finding and integrating **alternatives** to Big Tech platforms
* Tools and ecosystems include:

>  * Email & calendar: **Proton**
>  * Domains/DNS: **Porkbun**
>  * Operating systems: **Ubuntu**, **GrapheneOS**, **LineageOS**
>  * Hardware: **System76**, **de-Googled Pixel**, **Raspberry Pi 4**, **Synology**, **Garmin**
  
## Blockchain Infrastructure

* Running and maintaining **Proof-of-Stake validator nodes** (e.g., **ETH2**, **Rocketpool**)
* Hands-on with **node configuration**, **performance monitoring**, and **validator uptime** strategies
* Emphasis on **privacy**, **decentralization**, and **non-custodial infrastructure**
* Typically hosted in **custom Ubuntu servers** or **virtual machines** with DNS integration
* Provide training on **self-custody**, **hardware wallets** and **web3 basics**

## Soft Skills

* Trained in **Agile/Scrum** methodologies
* Comfortable **leading teams** and collaborating with **stakeholders**
* Known for being **collaborative**, **adaptable**, and **deeply personable**

## What I Am *Not*

Just to set expectations:

* **Hardware builder** – I don’t assemble machines (yet!)
* **Frontend designer** – I don't do graphic design or copywriting.
* **Frontend developer** - I'm not an expert in CSS or ReactJS, so any frontend code I write is likely to be generated by bots.
* **WordPress designer** – If it needs a visual editor, it’s not my thing (unless GPT can do it!)
* **Electrical engineer** – No custom wiring, please!
* **Data engineer** – I know just enough SQL to get into trouble, but CTEs aren’t my comfort zone.
* **Machine learning engineer** – I don’t maths. No PyTorch. No tensor stuff. Please don’t ask.

## What I Charge

My **rates** reflect the **depth and breadth** of work I do—covering *backend development, AI integration, infrastructure, privacy tooling, and blockchain systems*.

I offer **hourly**, **project-based**, and **nonprofit/mission-aligned** pricing:

### Hourly Work
- **Standard development**: `$120/hr`
- **Architecture, consulting, or training**: `$150/hr+`
- **Urgent or short-notice engagements**: `$175–250/hr`

### Project-Based Work
- **API/webhook/integration setups**: `$3K–8K`
- **LLM deployment stacks (e.g. RAG, automation, UI)**: `$10K–20K+`
- **Validator node infrastructure & privacy hosting**: `$5K–15K`
- **Retainer for ongoing support/maintenance**: `$3K–5K/month`

### Nonprofit / Mission-Aligned Work

I care about **ethical tech**, open-source, digital rights, and privacy. So I’m open to working with **nonprofits**, **cooperatives**, and **grassroots organizations** whose values *align with mine*.

If that’s you, I offer:

- **Discounted rates** on a case-by-case basis
- Flexible project scopes
- Prioritization of privacy, sustainability, and community ownership

*If budget is a constraint but the mission is compelling, let’s talk. I'm open to creative arrangements that respect both our time and values.*

> **Note**: I do not build or front costs for custom hardware (e.g. servers, nodes, network equipment). If your project requires hardware, you are responsible for purchasing and shipping it. Hardware costs are **not included** in any of the pricing listed above.
> 
> **Also Note**: I typically do **not** begin work until I’ve received payment for the first project milestone and have been provided with any required tools—this may include custom hardware, API keys, service credentials, or other third-party dependencies.

I believe in the importance of valuing time and expertise, and I ensure that my charges reflect this. For for-profit companies engaging in per-hour projects, I charge a minimum of `$120/hr`. This is not an arbitrary figure but a reflection of the high technical skills required and the substantial investment I've made in the tools needed to deliver quality results. For a month-long project (4 weeks) working 40 hours per week, this would equate to approximately **$20K**.

If you find my rates to be higher than those you've encountered elsewhere, I encourage you to trust in the services I offer. The intricate nature of the work I do and the expense of maintaining and updating cutting-edge tools make these rates industry-standard. I value my time and expertise just as much as you do, and I strive to deliver the best possible results in the most efficient manner.

Also, I typically work on engagements of no less than **$5K**, depending on the scope. Final pricing depends on complexity, deliverables, and timeline. Let’s figure out what makes sense for your goals.
